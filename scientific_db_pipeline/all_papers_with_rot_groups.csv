26,Feature Weight Tuning for Recursive Neural Networks,"This paper addresses how a recursive neural network model can automatically
leave out useless information and emphasize important evidence, in other words,
to perform ""weight tuning"" for higher-level representation acquisition. We
propose two models, Weighted Neural Network (WNN) and Binary-Expectation Neural
Network (BENN), which automatically control how much one specific unit
contributes to the higher-level representation. The proposed model can be
viewed as incorporating a more powerful compositional function for embedding
acquisition in recursive neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate the
significant improvement over standard neural models.",2014,886,73.83333333333333,,http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3714v2,High ROT

Natural Language Understanding, holistic architectures that answer on questions
about the content of real-world images have emerged. In this tutorial, we build
a neural-based approach to answer questions about images. We base our tutorial
on two datasets: (mostly on) DAQUAR, and (a bit on) VQA. With small tweaks the
models that we present here can achieve a competitive performance on both
datasets, in fact, they are among the best methods that use a combination of
LSTM with a global, full frame CNN representation of an image. We hope that
after reading this tutorial, the reader will be able to use Deep Learning
frameworks, such as Keras and introduced Kraino, to build various architectures

41,Robust Document Representations using Latent Topics and Metadata,"Task specific fine-tuning of a pre-trained neural language model using a
custom softmax output layer is the de facto approach of late when dealing with
document classification problems. This technique is not adequate when labeled
examples are not available at training time and when the metadata artifacts in
a document must be exploited. We address these challenges by generating
document representations that capture both text and metadata artifacts in a
task agnostic manner. Instead of traditional auto-regressive or auto-encoding
based training, our novel self-supervised approach learns a soft-partition of
the input space when generating text embeddings. Specifically, we employ a
pre-learned topic model distribution as surrogate labels and construct a loss
function based on KL divergence. Our solution also incorporates metadata
explicitly rather than just augmenting them with text. The generated document
embeddings exhibit compositional characteristics and are directly used by
downstream classification tasks to create decision boundaries from a small
number of labeled examples, thereby eschewing complicated recognition methods.
We demonstrate through extensive evaluation that our proposed cross-model
fusion solution outperforms several competitive baselines on multiple datasets.",2020,490,81.66666666666667,,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12681v1,High ROT
37,"Beyond Scale: The Diversity Coefficient as a Data Quality Metric for
  Variability in Natural Language Data","Current trends in pre-training Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus
on the scaling of model and dataset size. While the quality of pre-training
data is considered an important factor for training powerful LLMs, it remains a
nebulous concept that has not been rigorously characterized. To this end, we
propose a formalization of one key aspect of data quality -- measuring the
variability of natural language data -- specifically via a measure we call the
diversity coefficient. Our empirical analysis shows that the proposed diversity
coefficient aligns with the intuitive properties of diversity and variability,
e.g., it increases as the number of latent concepts increases. Then, we measure
the diversity coefficient of publicly available pre-training datasets and
demonstrate that their formal diversity is high compared to theoretical lower
and upper bounds. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive set of controlled
interventional experiments with GPT-2 and LLaMAv2 that demonstrate the
diversity coefficient of pre-training data characterizes useful aspects of
downstream model evaluation performance -- totaling 44 models of various sizes
(51M to 7B parameters). We conclude that our formal notion of diversity is an
important aspect of data quality that captures variability and causally leads
to improved evaluation performance.",2023,252,84.0,,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13840v3,High ROT

language model training and merging. Leveraging model merging for weight
crossover and fine-tuning for weight mutation, EvoMerge establishes an

18,DopeLearning: A Computational Approach to Rap Lyrics Generation,"Writing rap lyrics requires both creativity to construct a meaningful,
interesting story and lyrical skills to produce complex rhyme patterns, which
form the cornerstone of good flow. We present a rap lyrics generation method
that captures both of these aspects. First, we develop a prediction model to
identify the next line of existing lyrics from a set of candidate next lines.
This model is based on two machine-learning techniques: the RankSVM algorithm
and a deep neural network model with a novel structure. Results show that the
prediction model can identify the true next line among 299 randomly selected
lines with an accuracy of 17%, i.e., over 50 times more likely than by random.
Second, we employ the prediction model to combine lines from existing songs,
producing lyrics with rhyme and a meaning. An evaluation of the produced lyrics
shows that in terms of quantitative rhyme density, the method outperforms the
best human rappers by 21%. The rap lyrics generator has been deployed as an
online tool called DeepBeat, and the performance of the tool has been assessed
by analyzing its usage logs. This analysis shows that machine-learned rankings

17,"Towards Explainable NLP: A Generative Explanation Framework for Text
  Classification","Building explainable systems is a critical problem in the field of Natural
Language Processing (NLP), since most machine learning models provide no
explanations for the predictions. Existing approaches for explainable machine
learning systems tend to focus on interpreting the outputs or the connections
between inputs and outputs. However, the fine-grained information is often
ignored, and the systems do not explicitly generate the human-readable
explanations. To better alleviate this problem, we propose a novel generative
explanation framework that learns to make classification decisions and generate
fine-grained explanations at the same time. More specifically, we introduce the
explainable factor and the minimum risk training approach that learn to
generate more reasonable explanations. We construct two new datasets that
contain summaries, rating scores, and fine-grained reasons. We conduct
experiments on both datasets, comparing with several strong neural network
baseline systems. Experimental results show that our method surpasses all

characterizing model and data uncertainties for natural language processing

popular convolutional, recurrent and attention-based neural models across many
Sentence Pair Scoring tasks and datasets. We discuss the problem of evaluating
randomized models, propose a statistically grounded methodology, and attempt to

44,"Recurrent Neural Networks with External Memory for Language
  Understanding","Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have become increasingly popular for the
task of language understanding. In this task, a semantic tagger is deployed to
associate a semantic label to each word in an input sequence. The success of
RNN may be attributed to its ability to memorize long-term dependence that
relates the current-time semantic label prediction to the observations many
time instances away. However, the memory capacity of simple RNNs is limited
because of the gradient vanishing and exploding problem. We propose to use an
external memory to improve memorization capability of RNNs. We conducted
experiments on the ATIS dataset, and observed that the proposed model was able
to achieve the state-of-the-art results. We compare our proposed model with
alternative models and report analysis results that may provide insights for

48,End-to-End Attention-based Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition,"Many of the current state-of-the-art Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech
Recognition Systems (LVCSR) are hybrids of neural networks and Hidden Markov
Models (HMMs). Most of these systems contain separate components that deal with
the acoustic modelling, language modelling and sequence decoding. We
investigate a more direct approach in which the HMM is replaced with a
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that performs sequence prediction directly at
the character level. Alignment between the input features and the desired
character sequence is learned automatically by an attention mechanism built
into the RNN. For each predicted character, the attention mechanism scans the
input sequence and chooses relevant frames. We propose two methods to speed up
this operation: limiting the scan to a subset of most promising frames and
pooling over time the information contained in neighboring frames, thereby
reducing source sequence length. Integrating an n-gram language model into the
decoding process yields recognition accuracies similar to other HMM-free
RNN-based approaches.",2015,1280,116.36363636363636,,http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04395v2,High ROT
51,Incorporating Copying Mechanism in Sequence-to-Sequence Learning,"We address an important problem in sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) learning
referred to as copying, in which certain segments in the input sequence are
selectively replicated in the output sequence. A similar phenomenon is
observable in human language communication. For example, humans tend to repeat
entity names or even long phrases in conversation. The challenge with regard to
copying in Seq2Seq is that new machinery is needed to decide when to perform
the operation. In this paper, we incorporate copying into neural network-based
Seq2Seq learning and propose a new model called CopyNet with encoder-decoder
structure. CopyNet can nicely integrate the regular way of word generation in
the decoder with the new copying mechanism which can choose sub-sequences in
the input sequence and put them at proper places in the output sequence. Our
empirical study on both synthetic data sets and real world data sets
demonstrates the efficacy of CopyNet. For example, CopyNet can outperform

selection and generation results reported to-date (with 59% relative
improvement in generation) on the benchmark WeatherGov dataset, despite using
no specialized features or linguistic resources. Using an improved k-nearest
neighbor beam filter helps further. We also perform a series of ablations and

topic information explicitly modeled as a Dirichlet latent variable. By
providing the proposed model topic awareness, it is more superior at
reconstructing input texts. Furthermore, due to the inherent interactions
between the newly introduced Dirichlet variable and the conventional
multivariate Gaussian variable, the model is less prone to KL divergence

different scripts. The document is mapped into a uniformly coded text of
numerical values. It is derived from the position of the letters in the text
line, based on their typographical characteristics. Each code is considered as
a gray level. Accordingly, the coded text determines a 1-D image, on which
texture analysis by run-length statistics and local binary pattern is
performed. It defines feature vectors representing the script content of the
document. A modified clustering approach employed on document feature vector
groups documents written in the same script. Experimentation performed on two
custom oriented databases of historical documents in old Cyrillic, angular and
round Glagolitic as well as Antiqua and Fraktur scripts demonstrates the

5,Learning Visual Question Answering by Bootstrapping Hard Attention,"Attention mechanisms in biological perception are thought to select subsets
of perceptual information for more sophisticated processing which would be
prohibitive to perform on all sensory inputs. In computer vision, however,
there has been relatively little exploration of hard attention, where some
information is selectively ignored, in spite of the success of soft attention,
where information is re-weighted and aggregated, but never filtered out. Here,
we introduce a new approach for hard attention and find it achieves very
competitive performance on a recently-released visual question answering
datasets, equalling and in some cases surpassing similar soft attention
architectures while entirely ignoring some features. Even though the hard
attention mechanism is thought to be non-differentiable, we found that the
feature magnitudes correlate with semantic relevance, and provide a useful
signal for our mechanism's attentional selection criterion. Because hard
attention selects important features of the input information, it can also be
more efficient than analogous soft attention mechanisms. This is especially
important for recent approaches that use non-local pairwise operations, whereby
computational and memory costs are quadratic in the size of the set of
features.",2018,1889,236.125,,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00300v1,High ROT

  from Infant Learning","After a surge in popularity of supervised Deep Learning, the desire to reduce
the dependence on curated, labelled data sets and to leverage the vast
quantities of unlabelled data available recently triggered renewed interest in
unsupervised learning algorithms. Despite a significantly improved performance
due to approaches such as the identification of disentangled latent
representations, contrastive learning, and clustering optimisations, the
performance of unsupervised machine learning still falls short of its
hypothesised potential. Machine learning has previously taken inspiration from
neuroscience and cognitive science with great success. However, this has mostly
been based on adult learners with access to labels and a vast amount of prior
knowledge. In order to push unsupervised machine learning forward, we argue
that developmental science of infant cognition might hold the key to unlocking
the next generation of unsupervised learning approaches. Conceptually, human
infant learning is the closest biological parallel to artificial unsupervised
learning, as infants too must learn useful representations from unlabelled
data. In contrast to machine learning, these new representations are learned
rapidly and from relatively few examples. Moreover, infants learn robust
representations that can be used flexibly and efficiently in a number of
different tasks and contexts. We identify five crucial factors enabling
infants' quality and speed of learning, assess the extent to which these have
already been exploited in machine learning, and propose how further adoption of
these factors can give rise to previously unseen performance levels in

reasoning system to act upon them to improve or enhance the learning system. On
the other hand, knowledge can not only be extracted from neural networks but
concept knowledge can also be inserted into neural network architectures. Since
integrating learning and reasoning is at the core of neuro-symbolic AI, the

15,"STL: A Signed and Truncated Logarithm Activation Function for Neural
  Networks","Activation functions play an essential role in neural networks. They provide
the non-linearity for the networks. Therefore, their properties are important
for neural networks' accuracy and running performance. In this paper, we
present a novel signed and truncated logarithm function as activation function.
The proposed activation function has significantly better mathematical
properties, such as being odd function, monotone, differentiable, having
unbounded value range, and a continuous nonzero gradient. These properties make
it an excellent choice as an activation function. We compare it with other
well-known activation functions in several well-known neural networks. The
results confirm that it is the state-of-the-art. The suggested activation
function can be applied in a large range of neural networks where activation

14,QTN-VQC: An End-to-End Learning framework for Quantum Neural Networks,"The advent of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers raises a
crucial challenge to design quantum neural networks for fully quantum learning
tasks. To bridge the gap, this work proposes an end-to-end learning framework
named QTN-VQC, by introducing a trainable quantum tensor network (QTN) for
quantum embedding on a variational quantum circuit (VQC). The architecture of
QTN is composed of a parametric tensor-train network for feature extraction and
a tensor product encoding for quantum embedding. We highlight the QTN for
quantum embedding in terms of two perspectives: (1) we theoretically
characterize QTN by analyzing its representation power of input features; (2)
QTN enables an end-to-end parametric model pipeline, namely QTN-VQC, from the
generation of quantum embedding to the output measurement. Our experiments on
the MNIST dataset demonstrate the advantages of QTN for quantum embedding over
other quantum embedding approaches.",2021,98,19.6,,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03861v3,Low ROT
3,"Show me your NFT and I tell you how it will perform: Multimodal
  representation learning for NFT selling price prediction","Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) represent deeds of ownership, based on blockchain
technologies and smart contracts, of unique crypto assets on digital art forms
(e.g., artworks or collectibles). In the spotlight after skyrocketing in 2021,
NFTs have attracted the attention of crypto enthusiasts and investors intent on
placing promising investments in this profitable market. However, the NFT
financial performance prediction has not been widely explored to date.
  In this work, we address the above problem based on the hypothesis that NFT
images and their textual descriptions are essential proxies to predict the NFT
selling prices. To this purpose, we propose MERLIN, a novel multimodal deep
learning framework designed to train Transformer-based language and visual
models, along with graph neural network models, on collections of NFTs' images
and texts. A key aspect in MERLIN is its independence on financial features, as
it exploits only the primary data a user interested in NFT trading would like
to deal with, i.e., NFT images and textual descriptions. By learning dense
representations of such data, a price-category classification task is performed
by MERLIN models, which can also be tuned according to user preferences in the
inference phase to mimic different risk-return investment profiles.
Experimental evaluation on a publicly available dataset has shown that MERLIN
models achieve significant performances according to several financial
assessment criteria, fostering profitable investments, and also beating
baseline machine-learning classifiers based on financial features.",2023,64,21.333333333333332,,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01676v2,Low ROT
11,Liquid Structural State-Space Models,"A proper parametrization of state transition matrices of linear state-space
models (SSMs) followed by standard nonlinearities enables them to efficiently
learn representations from sequential data, establishing the state-of-the-art
on a large series of long-range sequence modeling benchmarks. In this paper, we
show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by
a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are
causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition
module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We
show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state
transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based
structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new
state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term
dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an
average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full
raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with
a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in
performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes
into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and
inference.",2022,86,21.5,,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12951v1,Low ROT
35,"TextConvoNet:A Convolutional Neural Network based Architecture for Text
  Classification","In recent years, deep learning-based models have significantly improved the
Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Specifically, the Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), initially used for computer vision, has shown remarkable
performance for text data in various NLP problems. Most of the existing
CNN-based models use 1-dimensional convolving filters n-gram detectors), where
each filter specialises in extracting n-grams features of a particular input
word embedding. The input word embeddings, also called sentence matrix, is
treated as a matrix where each row is a word vector. Thus, it allows the model
to apply one-dimensional convolution and only extract n-gram based features
from a sentence matrix. These features can be termed as intra-sentence n-gram
features. To the extent of our knowledge, all the existing CNN models are based
on the aforementioned concept. In this paper, we present a CNN-based
architecture TextConvoNet that not only extracts the intra-sentence n-gram
features but also captures the inter-sentence n-gram features in input text
data. It uses an alternative approach for input matrix representation and
applies a two-dimensional multi-scale convolutional operation on the input. To
evaluate the performance of TextConvoNet, we perform an experimental study on
five text classification datasets. The results are evaluated by using various
performance metrics. The experimental results show that the presented
TextConvoNet outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning

8,Large Language Model Guided Tree-of-Thought,"In this paper, we introduce the Tree-of-Thought (ToT) framework, a novel
approach aimed at improving the problem-solving capabilities of auto-regressive
large language models (LLMs). The ToT technique is inspired by the human mind's
approach for solving complex reasoning tasks through trial and error. In this
process, the human mind explores the solution space through a tree-like thought
process, allowing for backtracking when necessary. To implement ToT as a
software system, we augment an LLM with additional modules including a prompter
agent, a checker module, a memory module, and a ToT controller. In order to
solve a given problem, these modules engage in a multi-round conversation with
the LLM. The memory module records the conversation and state history of the
problem solving process, which allows the system to backtrack to the previous
steps of the thought-process and explore other directions from there. To verify
the effectiveness of the proposed technique, we implemented a ToT-based solver
for the Sudoku Puzzle. Experimental results show that the ToT framework can
significantly increase the success rate of Sudoku puzzle solving. Our
implementation of the ToT-based Sudoku solver is available on GitHub:

Interpretable Machine Learning, which identify the training instances that are
most influential to a neural model's predictions on test instances. We use
these influential triples as adversarial deletions. We further propose a
heuristic method to replace one of the two entities in each influential triple

CIFAR-10 dataset, and sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset. In
all cases, AILA matches strong deep learning baselines (LSTMs, Transformers,

Notably, we implement and test two versions of the model - AILA-Architecture 1,
which uses simple linear layers as the connection mechanism between layers, and
AILA-Architecture 2, which implements an attention mechanism to selectively
focus on outputs from previous layers. Both architectures are applied in a
single-task learning setting, with each model trained separately for individual

through different inference patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that the

38,Early stopping by correlating online indicators in neural networks,"In order to minimize the generalization error in neural networks, a novel
technique to identify overfitting phenomena when training the learner is
formally introduced. This enables support of a reliable and trustworthy early
stopping condition, thus improving the predictive power of that type of
modeling. Our proposal exploits the correlation over time in a collection of
online indicators, namely characteristic functions for indicating if a set of
hypotheses are met, associated with a range of independent stopping conditions
built from a canary judgment to evaluate the presence of overfitting. That way,
we provide a formal basis for decision making in terms of interrupting the
learning process.
  As opposed to previous approaches focused on a single criterion, we take
advantage of subsidiarities between independent assessments, thus seeking both
a wider operating range and greater diagnostic reliability. With a view to
illustrating the effectiveness of the halting condition described, we choose to
work in the sphere of natural language processing, an operational continuum
increasingly based on machine learning. As a case study, we focus on parser
